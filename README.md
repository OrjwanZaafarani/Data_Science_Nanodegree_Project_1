## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project, I used Python 3 and installed the following libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Motivation

As part of my Udacity Nanodegree in Data Science, the project aimed at understanding the provided hotel services in Saudi Arabia. Specifically, the project answered the following questions:
1. What is the average customer-ratings of hotels in Riyadh
2. Do high-priced hotels relate to customer ratings?
3. What is the Best Saudi Arabian city in hotel prices?

## Files' Descriptions <a name="description"></a>

* [The Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/OrjwanZaafarani/Data_Science_Nanodegree_Project_1/blob/main/Project_1.ipynb) contains my detailed work to answer the above questions.
* [The Dataset](https://github.com/OrjwanZaafarani/Data_Science_Nanodegree_Project_1/blob/main/Saudi_Arabia_Hotels.csv) that comprises 1025 hotels in Saudi Arabia collected on 24 Apr 2020 from Booking.com.

</p>
The average customers' ratings for Riyadh's hotels are as the figure table. Also, as anticipated, as the star rating increases, the customers rating increases too.

* __Question 2:__

</p>
The value 0.44 suggest a weak positive correlation between the customers' ratings and the hotels' prices. On the other hand, as expected, the star rating moderately relate to the prices.

As the numbers suggest, __Dhahran__ culminated among the rest. On the other hand, the following cities were the worst:

1. Hotat Bani Tamim
2. King Abdullah Economic City
3. Unayzah
4. Half Moon Bay
5. Al Bukayriyah
